    /*
    After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

    You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

    Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

    Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

        // Your solution here
        if (d < 3) {
            return d * 40;
        } else if (d >= 3 && d < 7) {
            return d * 40 - 20;
        } else {
            return d * 40 - 50;
        }
    }
